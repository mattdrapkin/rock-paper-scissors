TOP Rock Paper Scissors JS Project

Learned a lot in this project. Final product could have been prettier with CSS and adding images, but figured I'd worry more about picking up the fundamentals of JS and the DOM.  First project using HTML/CSS/JS.  First project creating a feature branch to help maintain first MVP (which was only playable through the console).  Hopefully, we only go upwards from here.
